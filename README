This software implements a syntax to define grammars for semantic speech recognition.
It can compile the syntax into a tree in order to evaluate an incoming sentence as a String.

Check out the example grammar and the GUI runner to play with it, API documentation is coming shortly.

Even if this code is stable, the system is still under developing for any comments or question write to:
